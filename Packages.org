  - [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get][El-get]]

From documentation:

El-Get allows you to install and manage elisp code for Emacs. It
supports lots of different types of sources and is able to install
them, update them and remove them, but more importantly it will init
them for you. That means it will require the features you need, load
the necessary files, set the Info paths so that C-h i shows the new
documentation you now depend on, and finally call your own
initialisation code for you to setup the extension. Or call it a
package.

Features:

 - Download the package directly from source without central repository.
 - Asynchronous and fast download.
 - Easy Installation and update.

 - [[https://notmuchmail.org/notmuch-emacs/][notmuch-emacs]] - Notmuch Emacs Interface - One of the more popular
   Notmuch message reading clients is notmuch.el, or notmuch-emacs, an
   Emacs major mode for interacting with Notmuch. It is included in
   the Notmuch package (notmuch-emacs in Debian). The screenshots give
   a good overview of the mode.
